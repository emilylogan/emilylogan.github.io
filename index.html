    </a>
    
    <p>For a Journalism Public Relations Class, Emily and her group worked to create a tri-fold brochure for L'Arche Spokane. L’Arche’s old brochure was out of
date and was not visually pleasing. L'Arche wanted the new one to be more visually pleasing and to reduce the amount of unnecessary text.</p>

    <h3>L'Arche Social Media Posts</h2>
       <a href="CSS/WorkSamples/JournalismSocialMediaPosts.pdf">
      <img class="resumeLogo" src="img/paperLogo.png" alt="">
    </a>
    
    <p> For the same Journalism Public Relations Class, Emily and her group created social media posts for L'Arches' Christmas Tree Lot. For the past few years L’Arche has not been very active on their
social media. To reach the most people we as a group decided to create posts for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Facebook would increase L’Arches visibility to older audiences. Twitter would increase L’Arches visibility to professionals, and Instagram would
help L’Arche reach younger audiences.</p>
